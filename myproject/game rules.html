            Craps is an entertaining and exciting game of chance played with two
            regular dice with face values from 1 to 6.The objective of the game is to
            predict the outcome of the two dice total, based on your selected bets.

            There is a wide selection of bets on the Craps table, each type having its own payout and conditions for winning, and with each type of bet requiring different dice totals to be rolled. Some bets are resolved in one roll while others may take several rolls until they are resolved.
            <br>
            The game occurs in two phases: the Come Out roll phase and the Point roll phase. It is possible to place bets during both phases of the game. For each roll, the two dice are thrown by the dice launcher into the wall at the other side of the table. The result is displayed when the two dice have come to a rest on the table.
            <br>
            The puck in the user interface will show if the next roll is a Come Out roll (the puck says “OFF”) or a Point roll (the puck says “ON”). This is useful to know since you can place different bets depending on in which phase you are playing.

            The game flow begins with a Come Out roll ("OFF") for the fundamental

Pass Line or Don't Pass bets.If the sum of the two dice is 7 or 11 you

win on your Pass Line bet.If the sum of the dice is 2 or 3 you win on the

Don't Pass bet, and you push on the Don't Pass bet if the sum is 12.Your

bets then are returned and the game ends.Either way the bet is resolved

and a new Come Out roll will start.<br>

If any other total is rolled 4,5,6,8,9 or 10 that total is called the Point

The puck is now changed to "ON" and placed next to the rolled total on

the betting grid or highlight.The game will remain in the Point roll phase

until a total of 7 is rolled,or the same point number is rolled once again.<br>

Unlike any other bets that can be placed at any roll phase,bets on the

Pass Line or Don't Pass are available only during the Come Out roll phase

puck will show "OFF").If you joined the game during the Point roll phase,

you can participate in the roll by placing bets on Come or Don't Come.

These bets are much like the Pass Line and Don't Pass bets, except that

you will get a new rolled point number marked by your chips.<br>

Regardless of the game phase, you can always place bets before the

next roll of the dice during the betting time.<br>

To play,select which bets you would like to make and place your chips on

the betting table accordingly
